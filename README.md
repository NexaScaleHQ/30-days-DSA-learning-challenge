# NexaScale 30 Days DSA Learning Challenge

Welcome to the NexaScale 30 Days DSA Learning Challenge! ðŸ’»ðŸ“š This repository contains all the necessary information you need to participate in our DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning challenge. 

## Overview

This challenge is designed to help you learn and practice DSA concepts for 30 days straight. By participating in this challenge, you'll not only improve your DSA skills but also have a chance to get you closer to landing that dream job :bag: .

## Challenge Details
- The challenge runs for 30 days starting from May 1st, 2023.
- There are daily tasks to be completed and documented in the [NexaScale-DSA.md](https://github.com/NexaScaleHQ/30-days-DSA-learning-challenge/blob/main/NexaScale-DSA.md) file.
- Participants are encouraged to complete each daily task before the end of the day. 
- Participants are required to update their progress daily in the [NexaScale-DSA.md](https://github.com/NexaScaleHQ/30-days-DSA-learning-challenge/blob/main/NexaScale-DSA.md) file.
- Participants can use any programming language to complete the tasks.
